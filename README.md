# Movie-Ticket-Booking-System

## Project Overview
This program is a **movie ticket booking system** written in C. It allows users to:
1. View a list of available movies.
2. Check the seating arrangement for the selected movie.
3. Book seats for a movie, ensuring no double booking occurs.
4. Dynamically choose to book tickets for the same movie or switch to another movie.

The program is designed to provide a basic, command-line interface for managing movie ticket bookings efficiently.
